# Exploring Morality in Arguments - Data

We annotated the Dagstuhl Argument Quality Corpus (https://webis.de/data/dagstuhl-15512-argquality.html) with moral foundations according to the Moral Foundations Theory (https://moralfoundations.org/). The pdf file contains the annotation guidelines. The csv files contain the annotations of our two annotators. Each assignment comes along with a confidence between 0 (very unsure) and 9 (very sure).
